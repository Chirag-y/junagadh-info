                        <strong>History</strong>
                        <br>There is a legend in the Skanda Purana regarding the fair of Bhavnath. According to this
                        legend, when Shiva-Parvati was traveling in a chariot through the sky, her divine ornament falls
                        down near the temple of Bhavnath. Hence it is known as Vastra Putakshetra.
                        <br>
                        The procession of the Nagabavas, accompanied by the sound of conch during the Maha Puja on the
                        day of Maha Shivaratri, bathing in the Mrigi Kund and chanting at the foothills of Girnar is a
                        spiritual experience. According to a folktale, bathing in a Mrigi Kund brings salvation to the
                        people.<br>
                        Siddhas like Bhartuhari, Gopichand and Ashwatthama live in Girnar, the place of Navnath and
                        Mahasiddha. And on the day of Shivratri, these Siddha men come to bathe in Mrigi Kund. There is
                        also a belief that Siddha men do not appear outside once they have bathed in this Kund.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Religious significance</strong> <br>
                        In the fair of Bhavanath, Lord Bhavanath is worshiped at the midnight of Maha Shivaratri. A
                        large number of monks and Naga Sadhus come from all over Gujarat to pay homage to Mahapuja.
                        Almonries are also opened at various places for the visitors.
                        `<br>
                        On the day of Maagha Vad Navami, the flag of religion and culture is hoisted over the temple of
                        Lord Bhavanath. At this time, Nagabawa is seen riding on elephants, chanting conch and playing
                        various instruments, chanting Mahadev. The caves of Muchkund, Bhartuhari and Guru Dutt are also
                        very famous in this place. Millions of devotees come here to visit and enjoy the fair.

                        The Girnar Mountain is located in the Junagadh district of Gujarat, India. It is an important
                        pilgrimage site for Hindus and Jains. Since the 3rd century, it has been one of the major
                        religious places covered with 866 Hindu and Jain temples spread over the summits.
                        One needs to climb the 9999 steps to reach the final summit. Girnar Mountain is a sacred place
                        for both Digambar and Shwetambar Jains. Amba Mata Temple Gorakshanath Temple and Dattatreya
                        Temple are the major pilgrimage sites for the Hindu pilgrims.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There is a Tirthankara Neminath temple, a religious place for Jain devotees at Girnar, hence
                        they call Girnar as Neminath Mountain. Udan Khatola is about to complete the construction and
                        launch of Indiaâ€™s most technically advanced ropeway at Girnar. The ropeway length is 2126.4
                        meters having the ultra modern cabins.
                        <br>
                        The ropeway will take pilgrims to Ma Ambaji temple at Girnar providing immense convenience to
                        people who are otherwise unable to climb 5000 steps to reach the sumit. The Ropeway is the
                        largest one in Gujarat.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Udan Khatola is operating eight ropeways across India. The companies latest project is located
                        in Girnar, Gujarat and is one of the longest ropeways in the country. Today Udan Khatola,
                        carries over 7 million passengers annually.

                        'Udan Khatola' is the first and the largest ropeway brand in India. We have been in the ropeway
                        business for more than five decades since 1969 and are the pioneers in the field of ropeway in
                        India. The journey of Udan Khatola was started with the construction of ropeway at Ma Mansa Devi
                        Temple at Haridwar, Uttarakhand and since then there was no looking back.

                        The massive Girnar Yatra, also known as the Girnar Parikrama is a 36-kilometre long event.
                        Beginning at Rupayatan or the Dhudeshwar Temple in Bhavnath, the procession goes through the Gir
                        Forest area and ends at Girnar Taleti.

                        <br>
                        This 5-day sacred walk through the woods is believed to be a 5000-year-old tradition that was
                        even mentioned in the holy Shiva Purana. The Girnar Parikrama is said to be a unifying event as
                        people from all backgrounds rush to take part in it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong> First Part</strong> <br>
                        The first twelve-kilometre stretch starts at Bhavnath and touches upon Zina Bava Ni Madhi
                        through the dense forests of Ghodi. Here, the Hasnapur Dam is a major attraction as it is the
                        biggest dam in Junagadh. The temple of Chandramauleshwar can also be found on the way.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Second Part</strong> <br>
                        The second course of eight kilometres resumes at Zina Bava Ni Madhi and goes up until Malvela,
                        which is, in turn, a pretty temple en route.
                        <br>
                        Travellers could also reach Malvela via the Sarkhadiya Hanuman Temple, which is located within a
                        thicket, thus increasing the chances of either seeing wild animals or hearing them. Suraj Kund
                        is another attraction close to the Hanuman temple.

                        The next eight-kilometre walk is from Malvela to Bordevi. The latter sites a temple dedicated to
                        the goddess Bordevi here. However, this is the last spot in the procession, with the remaining
                        distance of eight kilometres being the return to Bhavnath from Bordevi.
