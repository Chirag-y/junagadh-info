                        Bhavnath Temple in Junagadh is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Shivling here is said to have
                        emerged of its own divine intention. The Bhavnath Mahadev temple existence dates back to the
                        ancient era and its story is found in the Puranic era. According to myth, once a while Lord
                        Shiva and goddess Parvati were crossing the Girnar hills and then their divine garment fell over
                        the present Mrigi Kund, making this place an auspicious site for Shiva worshippers. Even today,
                        the naga bavas are known to bathe in the holy Mrigi Kund before joining the Mahashivaratri
                        procession.

                        Just 5 km from Junagadh town, Girnar Hill is a majestic sacred mountain whose origins can be
                        traced back to the Vedas. It has been considered to be a religious place even as long before in
                        the Mohan-jo-Daro period.

                        The Girnar Hill trek begins at the Girnar Taleti. Located about 4 km east from Junagadh, this

                        Kund and Sri Ambaji Temple. The Girnar Hill course is a well-maintained path with proper
                        stone-ways. Visitors could also rest at the Dharamshalas on the way which are set up after every
                        2500 steps.

                        Flocked by Hindu and Jain pilgrims alike, this place is also nature's paradise located in midst
                        of the Gir Forest. Girnar offers its visitors some good trekking avenues, religious spots and
                        pre-historic sites and mountains.

                        At a distance of 4 km from Junagadh Junction, Shree Swaminarayan Temple is a revered Hindu
                        temple situated at Dipanjali locality of Junagadh. It is one of the important BAPS Mandirs in
                        Gujarat and among the top places to visit in Junagadh.
                        <br>
                        Located on Jawahar Road, Shri Swaminarayan Mandir is dedicated to Lord Swaminarayan - a Hindu
                        saint, yogi, ascetic and the founder of Swaminarayan Sampraday. This temple was ordered to be
                        built by Lord Swaminarayan himself, the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampraday. The land for this
                        temple was gifted by Jinabhai, Darbar of Panchala of King Hemant Singh. The foundation stone for
                        the temple was laid by Gunatitanand Swami in 1826 AD while the construction of this temple was
                        supervised by Brahmanand Swami.
                        <br>
                        On May 1, 1828 AD, Swaminarayan himself installed Shri Ranchhodrai and Trikamrai in the inner
                        sanctum, Radharaman Dev and Harikrishna Maharaj in the eastern wing and Siddheswar Mahadev,
                        Parvati, Ganesha and Nandishwar in the western side. The Mughal Subba Bahadur Khan paid a
                        personal visit to the place on this occasion. Swaminarayan appointed Gunatitanand Swami as the
                        first mahant, who served in this role for over 40 years.
                        <br>
                        The Swaminarayan temple has a circumference on 278 feet and has a great architecture with 5
                        spires and many sculptures. The mandir was built with pink stone of Rajasthan. The ambience of
                        the Mandir is very serene and peaceful, surrounded by trees and lush greenery and hills adds to
                        the divinity of the Temple. For spiritual individuals who are ardent in following and praying in
                        front of God, this place is nothing short of a heavenly bliss.

                        There is a group of Jain temples in Girnar and are all unique yet similar in architecture and
                        style. The Neminath Temple, built from 1128 AD to 1159 AD, is one of the main attractions.

                        The temple complex has quadrangle courtyards, corridors and other shrines as well, with pillars
                        adorned with intricate carvings of Jain Tirthankars. The idol of Bhagwan Neminatha here is
                        thought to be the oldest one in the world, approximately 84,785 years old. Innumerable monks
                        come here to attain Moksha. Girnar is an important religious place for the Jains.

                        Set up on the hill's 3300th step, there are over 860 Jain and Hindu temples at this location.
                        Referred to as Mount Neminath by Jain followers, the Neminath temple here is indeed the most
                        prominent and the largest shrine here.
                        Dedicated to the 22nd Tirthankara, Bhagavan Neminath, this temple is a memory of the day this
                        Jain deity attained nirvana after giving up all worldly necessities.
