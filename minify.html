They are carved out of living rock and later when they were abandoned monks moved towards the direction of Maharashtra where similar structures were replicated. <br> <br> The Uparkot caves on the very summit near the Uparkot fort are more spacious with provisions for a courtyard space and display a distinct influence of planned architecture. These are relatively more recent of the lot. The Bava Pyara caves which are slightly older than the Uparkot caves lie outside the Uparkot complex.
