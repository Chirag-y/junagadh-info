                        Somnath is a magnificent temple situated in Sagar Kant of Saurashtra in Gujarat state. One of
                        the 12 holy Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva is in Jyotirlinga here in Somnath. Somnath is also
                        mentioned in Rigveda. This temple of Somnath has been very attractive in front of many
                        destructive foreign invaders who want to lure and convert to the temple glory. Whenever the
                        temple has tried to destroy it, then it has been built again.
                        <br>It’s said that Somraj first built a temple in Somnath, made of gold; this
                        was rebuilt by Ravana in silver, by Krishna in wood and by Bhimdev in stone. The current serene,
                        symmetrical structure was built to traditional designs on the original coastal site: it’s
                        painted a creamy colour and boasts a little fine sculpture. The large, black Shiva lingam at its
                        heart is one of the 12 most sacred Shiva shrines, known as jyotirlinga.

                        of Sindh took his army and attacked the temple and destroyed the temple. Pratishtha King Nag
                        Bhatt II constructed the temple for the third time in 815 using a red stone.
                        In 1026, Mahmud Ghazni lent the precious jewels and property of Somnath temple. After looting,
                        slaughtering innumerable pilgrims of the temple and burning the temple and destroying it. During

                        of Malwa.Somnath was destroyed when Delhi Sultanate occupied Gujarat in 1299. In 1394 it was
                        destroyed again. In 1706, Mughal ruler Aurangzeb again demolished the temple.
