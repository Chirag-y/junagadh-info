        <strong>About City :</strong> <br>
        Junagadh is the 7th largest city in Gujarat and is situated at the foot of Girnar hills. Very few places in
        Gujarat
        offer what Junagadh has, a rich Historical significance and Cultural Diversity.

        The word Junagadh literally translates to the “Old Fort”.

        The proof of this fact is that it comprises of historical monuments starting from the very ancient age 500 BC
        till
        the most recent history of partition of India in 1947 AD.

        The rulers which have inhabited the city so far have contributed to shaping the city as per their own interests
        and
        cultural diversity.

        Hence, you can see edicts of Ashoka inscribed in Pali language on granite stones, the grand Uparkot Fort which
        has
        been the abode of many kings, masterpieces which were built in Indo-Islamic style coupled with Gothic art forms
        such as Mohabat Maqbara in Junagadh.
        <br>
        <br>
        Monuments is not the only thing which these rulers have given to Junagadh. So far, it has been known by various
        names like “Raivatachal”, “Raivatnagar”, “Revant”, “Manipur”, “Chandraketapur”, “Puratanpur”, “Pratappur”,
        “Narendrapur”, “Girinagar”, “Karan Kunj”, “Jirna Durg”, “Mustafabad” and finally the present name “Junagadh” was
        given by the British Government in 1820 AD.

        This city has been a tourist attraction for over years not only because of it’s immense Cultural and Historical
        importance but also because of it has a plethora of temples and mosques which provides peace to the soul of
        religious people.

        Every day hundreads of tourists visit the city for religious, entertainment and educational purpose.
        <br><br>
        The two main reasons which give the tag of fame to Junagadh are “Parikrama” (Held in October-November during the
        period of five days concluding on the full-moon day of Kartik Month) and “Maha Shivratri” (Held in
        February-March on
        the No-Moon-day of Magha Month) every year. The importance of these festivals is not only up to local level but
        has
        also spread over the national and international level. NagaBawa’s or Naked Sages come to take part in these
        festivals from all over India. Every year on an average more than 1 Million people visit Junagadh during these
        two
        festivals only and it’s a major economic source as well.
        <br><br>
        <strong> Apart from this, the major attractions from Junagadh are: </strong> <br>

        Mount Girnar which is older than even the Himalayas and is one of the main pilgrim places for Jains, Sakkarbaug
        Zoo
        which is the second oldest and fourth biggest zoo in India, various step -wells and caves built during different
        eras, homes dating back to the time of yore reminding of the time when India was known as Golden Bird and you
        can
        keep exploring till you are satisfied.

                <br> <strong>How Junagadh got Freedom</strong> <br>
                The issue of Junagadh’s accession formally arose when on 17 August 1947, the Indian Press reported that
                the Nawab of Junagadh had chosen to join Pakistan . On 13 September, Pakistan informed India that it had
                accepted the accession and had signed a standstill agreement with the state. Junagadh’s decision
                infuriated the other Kathiawar states and protests poured into Delhi . Lord Mountbatten, now Governor
                General of India , dispatched his Chief Staff, Lord Ismay, to Karachi for consultations. On his return,
                Lord Ismay stated that, in his opinion, the Government of Pakistan was trying to provoke India into
                taking a step which would discredit her in the eyes of the world and obtain sympathy for Pakistan as an
                aggrieved party. Junagadh, he stressed, was an economic and administrative unit firmly embedded in
                Kathiawar , and as such could only be a liability to Pakistan in every sphere.
                <br><br>
                The Sheikh of Mangrol, a very small state adjoining Junagadh, who had not announced his choice, now
                signed a standstill agreement and instrument of accession with India . The Nawab of Junagadh refused to
                recognise this accession, asserting that as an “attached state”, Mangrol was his vassal and had no right
                to conduct negotiations without his authority. The Sheikh maintained that with paramountcy lapsing, he
                was independent. Apprehensive that other “vassals” might follow Mangrol’s example, the Nawab dispatched
                his state force troops into Babariawad, an area comprising estates whose rulers challenged the Nawab’s
                overlordship and had acceded to India . The Government of India, thereupon, requested the Nawab of
                Junagadh to remove his state troops from Babariawad. In order to protect the areas that had acceded to
                India , an infantry brigade of the Indian Army was dispatched to Kathiawar . The brigade commander was
                ordered not to violate Junagadh territory and not even to enter Mangrol and Babariawad, but to deploy
                his troops only in other territories that had acceded to India . Exchange of communications between
                India and Pakistan bore no fruit. Eventually, on November 1, India dispatched civil administrators, each
                accompanied by a small token force, to take over the administration of Mangrol and Babariawad.
                <br><br>
                The unsettled conditions in Junagadh had led to a cessation of all trade with India and the food
                position became precarious. The people organised a popular movement. forced the Nawab to flee to Karachi
                with his family and established a provisional government. Before leaving the Nawab had emptied the state
                treasury of its cash and securities. The Dewan of Junagadh, Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the father of the more
                famous Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, now decided to invite the Government of India to intervene. Indian troops
                thereafter marched into the state.
                <br><br>
                On 9 November 1948, with the unanimous approval of the state council and leaders of public opinion, the
                administration of the state was handed over to India . In the absence of any constructive proposal from
                Pakistan , the Government of India held a referendum on 20 February 1948, to ascertain the wishes of the
                people regarding accession. In Junagadh, more than 190,000 votes were cast out of an electorate of
                200,000. Those voting for Pakistan totalled 91, and the rest voted for India . In Mangrol, Manavadar and
                certain adjoining estates, Pakistan ’s share of the 31, 434 votes cast was 39. Thus ended a chapter full
                of incident, but one, which could have been avoided if Pakistan had not encouraged the Nawab of Junagadh
                in his absurdity. Pakistan still continues to include Junagadh within its territory in its official
                maps.
